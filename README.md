# Facial-Recognition-and-Algorithm-Accountability
Under the guidance of professor Ioannis Kakadiaris and mentor Haileleol Tibebu at the University of Houston, this project investigates facial recognition algorithms to understand the logic behind their decisions from a fairness and model explainability perspective, while exploring the impact of biased training datasets on outcomes.
